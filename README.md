# 🏢 Centralized Queuing System for Pag-IBIG Office

## 📘 Project Overview
This project presents a **Centralized Queuing System** for the **Pag-IBIG Office** designed to organize and manage client queues efficiently across multiple help desks. It ensures that all visitors are served in a fair, systematic, and synchronized manner while allowing real-time monitoring and flexibility for queue adjustments when needed.

## 🧩 Problem Statement
The **Pag-IBIG office** implements a centralized queuing system for three help desk stations. Individuals visiting the office obtain a queue number from this centralized system. Additionally, there's an **online monitoring system** that displays the current queued number in real-time for individuals monitoring the queue remotely.  

Each help desk station has an option to **reset the queuing number** based on an inputted number, allowing flexibility in managing the queue during specific situations, such as reorganization or technical issues.  

This queuing system ensures a **single centralized queue number** for all help desk stations, while the reset option offers control and adjustment in exceptional circumstances.  

This approach aims to maintain an **organized queuing process** for individuals visiting the office and provides the **flexibility** to handle queue adjustments as needed.
